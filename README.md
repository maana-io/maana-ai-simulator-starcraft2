# StarCraft II Learning Environment for Maana Q

- Uses the [Python (Ariadne) Maana Q Knowledge Service](https://github.com/maana-io/q-template-service-python-ariadne) template
- Uses the [Python-SC2](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2) library for communicating with the game engine, as it provides a higher-level interface that doesn't require visual interpretation of the game state
- Containerization is done using the [Uvicorn+Gunicorn Docker](https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-docker) base image
